# Body_Rocking_Behaviour_Recognition
Wearable sensors have been shown to be effective for promoting self-awareness, wellness and re-education. For this project, you will develop a detector for Body-rocking behavior from a blind subject (also commonly observed in individuals with autism) using inertial measurements from a wearable system. Two sensors, one of the wrist and another on the arm (as illustrated on the right), were used to record motion using accelerometers and gyroscopes. The data will consists of sessions about 1-2 hours long each with annotations of when the behavior was observed. Your goal will be to train a classifier for the detections of these events.
